- Write a local-search algorithm (eg. an EA) able to solve the *Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls

EA algorithm with onecut crossover and bitflip mutation by 1/5 of genome length.
Tournament selection with different tournament sizes and island model with fixed size.
